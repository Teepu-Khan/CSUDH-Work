Project 4 (Operating Systems) Page Reference Algorithms
Professor Chatterjee / Tang




To run the program please run the Project4_OS.java class which contains our main class (driver).

User will be prompted to enter three items:
- # of page references
- a value for the range of the page reference # (ex. 0 to the value entered)
- # of physical frames

The program automatically displays three algorithms in order, with the sequence of numbers in physical frames, and the total number of page faults.
FIFO - First In First Out - implemented by Daniel J. Gallegos, who also implemented the Page class and helped with understanding implementations of other algorithms
LRU - Least Recently Used - implemented by Teepu Khan
OPTIMAL - Pre-emptive Least Used - implemented by Teepu Khan, also helped with understanding implementation of FIFO
