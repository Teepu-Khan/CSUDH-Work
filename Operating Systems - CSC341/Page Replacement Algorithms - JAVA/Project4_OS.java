/*
 * Description: This is the class that contains the main function. The user inputs values
 * for the number of page references, page reference number range and the number
 * of physical frames. A Pages object is then created and then tested with all
 * of the 3 page fault optimization algorithms. The idea is to compare number of
 * page faults between the three types of algorithms.
 *
 * Programmers: Daniel Gallegos and Teepu Khan
 * Date: May 8, 2017
 * Course: CSC341 @ CSUDH

 * Class: Project4_OS.java
