Programmer: Teepu Khan

For my senior project, required to be able to graduate, I completed a video game that is based around the concept of color. A final
version of the game with all features implemented as originally planned will be included at a later date. As it stands, the product
that is a result of my work is included via a link here. To avoid adding non-code clutter to this repository, the link will direct you
to my Google Drive where all the documentation is kept. Most of it is documentation covering my entire process from the start of the 
project all the way to completion.
